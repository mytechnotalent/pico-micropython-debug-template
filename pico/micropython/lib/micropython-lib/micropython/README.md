MicroPython-specific libraries
==============================

These are libraries that have been written specifically for use on MicroPython.

In some cases, the libraries are inspired by or based on equivalent CPython standard libraries, but compatibility varies. The libraries are often named with a "u" prefix.

Other libraries have been written specifically for MicroPython use cases.

Future plans
------------

* More organised directory structure based on library purpose (e.g. drivers, network, etc).
